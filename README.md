# BigDataAnalysis

## About
Accidents caused by large trucks are among the leading causes of injuries and deaths in the United States. The aim is to identify dangerous commercial truck drivers based on various factors including speeding, unsafe following, lane departure, and other unsafe driving practices. Truck fleet data is analyzed and refined, while truck movements are examined to understand the risks associated with commercial trucking.
